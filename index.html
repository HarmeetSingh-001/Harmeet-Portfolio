    <h1> Harmeet Singh's Portfolio (WIP)</h1>
    <h2> Websites </h2>

    <h3> UPositive </h3>
    <p>
        This was a team project. The purpose was to develop a website for a client who founded the company/idea of UPositive.
        This was meant to be a way for the client to display goodies of the month, allow users to subscribe to the client's monthly
        gifts, and allow users to have a space to share their own findings. The website also had cat pictures since the client wanted to
        show of the cat. The client's overall purpose was to spread positivity through gifts and sharing experiences. 

        My part of this project primarily consisted of developing the Forum Page to allow users to make posts.
    </p>
    <i>There are 2 links for the same webpage due to how it was hosted and if one link does not work, use the other.</i><br/>

    <h3> Harmeet's Codex (Partial WIP) </h3>
    <p>
        This is a site I intend to be used for myself to display anything or to store anything I find useful.
        This includes games I like, a tab about me and some home page. However these 3 pages are not working right now
        as the main use for the website so far for me has been the calculators and is the only page that is actively
        updated and truly functional.
        Warframe Calculators is a page for calculating the maximum number of runs you are expected to run for a given Warframe
        farm based on what you are going to farm as well.

    <h3> Daughter Band Website </h3>
    <P> 
        This project was designed to practice using HTML and CSS. The website covers a band I enjoy called "Daughter".
        The pages consist of a home page with an introduction as well as featured songs. There is a page with albums.
        A list of past events on the events page. A small about the band page. A non functioning sign-up page just used 
        as a mock sign-up as there is no actual system storing user information.

    <h2> Games </h2>

    <h3> Knight Shift Demo</h3>
    <P> 
        Knight Shift was a game concept that I along with 2 other students, Brandon Le and Joshua Jones, came up with for a final class project.
        The game was created as a small demo. My work consisted of mainly two items. Buff Orbs and Animations.
        Buff Orbs: These were orbs that on contact would alter the stats of the player at random.
        Animations: Most of the animations were completed by me using free assets found in the Unity store or online.

    <h3> Wordle Copy Project </h3>
    <P> 
        This Worlde Clone was a project to practice using javascript and api's to create a functioning clone. The game is fully playable with
        a set wordlist and ability to check average guesses.
