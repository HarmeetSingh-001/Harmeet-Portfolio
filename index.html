    <h1> Harmeet Singh's Portfolio (WIP)</h1>
    <h2> Websites </h2>

    <h3> UPositive </h3>
    <p>
        This was a team project. The purpose was to develop a website for a client who founded the company/idea of UPositive.
        This was meant to be a way for the client to display goodies of the month, allow users to subscribe to the client's monthly
        gifts, and allow users to have a space to share their own findings. The website also had cat pictures since the client wanted to
        show of the cat. The client's overall purpose was to spread positivity through gifts and sharing experiences. 

        My part of this project primarily consisted of developing the Forum Page to allow users to make posts.
    </p>
    <i>There are 2 links for the same webpage due to how it was hosted and if one link does not work, use the other.</i><br/>

    <h3> Harmeet's Codex (Partial WIP) </h3>
    <p>
        This is a site I intend to be used for myself to display anything or to store anything I find useful.
        This includes games I like, a tab about me and some home page. However these 3 pages are not working right now
        as the main use for the website so far for me has been the calculators and is the only page that is actively
        updated and truly functional.
        Warframe Calculators is a page for calculating the maximum number of runs you are expected to run for a given Warframe
        farm based on what you are going to farm as well.

    <h3> Daughter Band Website </h3>
    <P> 
        This project was designed to practice using HTML and CSS. The website covers a band I enjoy called "Daughter".
        The pages consist of a home page with an introduction as well as featured songs. There is a page with albums.
        A list of past events on the events page. A small about the band page. A non functioning sign-up page just used 
        as a mock sign-up as there is no actual system storing user information.

    <h3> Harmeet's Top Games </h3>
    <P> 
        This project was designed to practice using HTML, CSS, JS and database connections to make a e-commerce site. 
        This one utilized PHP for all backend data management.
        The site lets you browse some of my top picked games and add them to a cart with a certain amount and then your cart will let you proceed to check out.
        There is no actual charge or information gather from user aside from what games they picked. Once an order is placed it is updated to the Orders and every order is visible with 
        time stamps and the full list of games ordered.
    </P>
    <i> You may need to alter the url query to update if using the link or switching between pages before using the site </i><br/>

    <h3> VibeZ </h3>
    <P> 
        This project was designed to practice using everything involving web development. HTML, CSS, JS, API calls, and database mangement. This was also a group project.
        My part of this project consists of the front end functions as well as api calls to our choice of api "Deezer" to fetch songs. Then sending them to our custom database through MongoDb
        The idea of this website was to create an app similar to letterbox to rate songs you listen to and find new songs through a sort of speed dating for songs section.
        From the home page you want to head down to the login or sign-up page. The authentication is not too secure so do not truly use a real password or username. Once you login you will be directed to the true site where
        you can search for songs by genre, however you can not search with a search bar since we do not want the users to be able to find whatever song they like but rather experience songs they might not have before.
        Speed Search is your speed dating app. Like or dislike songs and it will continue to find you new songs you might enjoy. You will also rate the song when you like it and then can remove or update it in My Songs tab.

    <h2> Games </h2>

    <h3> Knight Shift Demo</h3>
    <P> 
        Knight Shift was a game concept that I along with 2 other students, Brandon Le and Joshua Jones, came up with for a final class project.
        The game was created as a small demo. My work consisted of mainly two items. Buff Orbs and Animations.
        Buff Orbs: These were orbs that on contact would alter the stats of the player at random.
        Animations: Most of the animations were completed by me using free assets found in the Unity store or online.

    <h3> Wordle Copy Project </h3>
    <P> 
        This Worlde Clone was a project to practice using javascript and api's to create a functioning clone. The game is fully playable with
