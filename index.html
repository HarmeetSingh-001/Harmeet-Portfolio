    <h3> Knight Shift Demo</h3>
    <P> 
        Knight Shift was a game concept that I along with 2 other students, Brandon Le and Joshua Jones, came up with for a final class project.
        The game was created as a small demo. My work consisted of mainly two items. Buff Orbs and Animations.
        Buff Orbs: These were orbs that on contact would alter the stats of the player at random.
        Animations: Most of the animations were completed by me using free assets found in the Unity store or online.

    <h3> Wordle Copy Project </h3>
    <P> 
        This Worlde Clone was a project to practice using javascript and api's to create a functioning clone. The game is fully playable with
        a set wordlist and ability to check average guesses.
